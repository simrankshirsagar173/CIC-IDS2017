# 🔐 Intrusion Detection Using Machine Learning (CIC-IDS2017)

This project is part of my **Data Mining and Machine Learning** coursework at the **National College of Ireland**.  
It shows how to use **machine learning models** to detect attacks in network traffic using the **CIC-IDS2017 dataset**.

---

## 📦 What’s in the Project?

- Combined 8 real network traffic datasets (Monday–Friday)
- Preprocessed the data to remove missing or invalid values
- Used **LabelEncoder** to convert text to numbers
- Scaled the data using **StandardScaler**
- Applied **PCA** to reduce dimensions (make the dataset smaller but still useful)

---

## 🧠 Machine Learning Models Used

- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Random Forest

---

## 📈 How We Evaluated the Models

- Accuracy
- Precision, Recall, F1-Score
- Confusion Matrix
- ROC and PR (Precision-Recall) Curves

---

## 📁 Files Included

- `DMML_CIC-IDS2017.ipynb` – The main notebook with all code and results

---

## 📚 Tools Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

---

## 🙋 Who Is This For?

- Beginners/Freshers in Data Science or Cybersecurity
- Anyone who wants to learn how to detect network attacks using simple ML steps
